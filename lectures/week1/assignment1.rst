Assignment 1
============

Ideas para la tarea1:

Tema: algebra relacional

Realizar una introduccion (su historia loca, como en las tareas del departamento)

1) traducir
  * Poner consultas gformuladas y pedir que las expresen en algebra relacional
  * POner consultas en algebra relacional y pedir que las expresen en lenguaje natural

2) formular
  * Solicitar cierta informacion de las tablas de la BD, en algebra relacional y lenguaje natural

3) alternativas?
  * en la videolectura 4 aparece una pregunta asi (solo al verla online, al bajarla no)
No se me ocurre agregar algo respecto a las lecturas 1 y 2, que son mas introductorias.

Ser√≠a bueno agregar http://www.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/ra/, un interprete en java de algebra relacional???
